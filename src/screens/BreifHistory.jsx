            Jara Beach Resort is co-founded and managed by husband-and-wife team Mark and Millie
            Slade. With a combined 30+ years in the hospitality industry, you can be sure every
            element has been considered to ensure the very best experience at Jara. The Slades came
            to the area in 2016 and leased a beach hut which became known as Lil Zanzibar, just five
            minutes walk from the Jara you know today. Little Zanzibar became a rustic home away
            from home - with many amazing beach days spent with family and friends. It was even the
            location where Millie said ‘yes!’. Beach days were always too short and the need to
            sleep comfortably was a problem that the couple wanted to solve. In 2019, a walk along
            the beach and ‘Chakaville’ was discovered - the annex extension of neighbouring hotel
            Chaka. <br />
            The vision was created and Jara was born. After 12 weeks of renovation, construction and
            general preparation, Jara welcomed its first guests on November 8th, 2019. Initially
            opening with six rooms, Jara operated for only 12 weeks before closing due to COVID-19.
            In June 2020 Jara reopened, later launching its three spacious family cabins in October,
            2020. In December 2021 our villas opened. In April 2022 our 12th room - the Loft’
            welcomed its first guests.
            <br />
            Jara’s mission remains; to provide the very best, safe and secure overnight, indulgent
            beach experience, responsibly ​
            <br />
            Jara Beach Resort is committed to being a responsible hospitality establishment. We
            operate fully 'off' the national grid and are working our way towards full
            sustainability. From solar technology to limited generator running time, Jara continues
            to balance environmentally-friendly best practice with providing the very best beach
            experience in Nigeria. We welcome all guests to help be a part of the solution! Find out
